# MCP Tool Ideas

## User Identification Tool
**Status**: Requires investigation
**Complexity**: High
**Dependencies**: Internal auth system

### Concept
A tool that allows the MCP server to identify the current user, enabling:
- Personalized responses
- Access control
- User-specific operations

### Current Understanding
- Browser certificate authentication at ingress
- JWT tokens for internal service auth
- Internal API to resolve user info from passnumber

### Questions to Investigate
1. How does the MCP server receive auth information?
   - Does it see the original certificate?
   - Does it receive a JWT?
   - Where in the request chain is it positioned?

2. What user information is available?
   - What user details can we access?

3. Security considerations
   - How to securely handle user info?
   - What permissions are needed?
   - How to prevent unauthorized access?

### Next Steps
1. Investigate auth flow at work
2. Map out service interactions
3. Identify where user info can be obtained
4. Design secure implementation

- Check for common error patterns
- Monitor resource usage
- Track deployment status
- Check service health
- Query events and warnings
- Support multiple clusters
- Handle RBAC permissions

---
### Network Information
**Specific Use Case**: Service Health Checks
- When an MCP client tool fails to respond
- Check if the target service is reachable
- Help diagnose network vs service issues
- Example: Jira client fails â†’ check if Jira is reachable

---
### GitLab Integration
- Create/update merge requests
- Review and comment on code
- Trigger CI/CD pipelines
- Monitor pipeline status
- Search repositories and code

  - Create branches
  - Create/update issues
  - Manage labels and milestones
  - Handle merge conflicts
- Access project documentation
- Track project metrics and analytics
- Support multiple GitLab instances
- Handle authentication and permissions
- Integrate with existing review workflows

- Features:
  - Metadata support (title, author (pulled from certificate), date (fetched from datetime mcp))
  - Watermarking options (AI GENERATED)
- PDF Storage and Serving:
  - Use MinIO for ephemeral storage
  - Generate pre-signed URLs for downloads
  - Configure 24-hour lifecycle rules for automatic cleanup
  - Serve through existing proxy at artifacts.contesso.net
